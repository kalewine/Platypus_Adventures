She has been a pediatric speech language pathologist since 2004 and worked with kids and adults with special needs since 1998. Inclusion has always been a passion for her. She wants to make sure that nobody feels left out! Alison and Melissa wanted to bring new opportunities for youth with special needs to Greenville, SC. This began with the Tri My Best event. The positive support from the community encouraged us to form Platypus Adventures to bring more adaptive opportunities. Alison also enjoys spending time with her husband, Brandon, and three amazing children!</p></div><div class="leader"><picture class="leader__headshot-container"><source type="image/webp" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 60vw, 20vw" srcset="../../images/webp/platypus-adventures-melissa-seward@1x.webp 360w, ../../images/webp/platypus-adventures-melissa-seward@2x.webp 480w"><img class="leader__headshot" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 60vw, 20vw" srcset="../../images/platypus-adventures-melissa-seward@1x.jpg 360w, ../../images/platypus-adventures-melissa-seward@2x.jpg 480w" src="../../images/platypus-adventures-melissa-seward@2x.jpg" alt="headshot of Platypus Adventures leader Melissa Seward"></picture><h2 class="leader__name">Melissa Seward</h2><p class="leader__text">Melissa Seward is a native of Ohio who moved to Greenville, SC in 2010 to pursue a career as a pediatric physical therapist. Sports have been a passion of hers since childhood. She started playing organized sports at six and has continued to this day playing ultimate frisbee. She is a strong believer that everyone should have the opportunity to participate no matter what it looks like!! With limited opportunities for these athletes in the Upstate, she and Alison decided to create them which led to the formation of Platypus Adventures. When not playing sports she can be found working out, crocheting, reading, hiking, hanging out with friends, and cheering on the Kentucky Wildcats and the Kentucky State Thorobreds.</p></div><div class="leader"><picture class="leader__headshot-container"><source type="image/webp" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 60vw, 20vw" srcset="../../images/webp/platypus-adventures-grace-edwards@1x.webp 360w, ../../images/webp/platypus-adventures-grace-edwards@2x.webp 480w"><img class="leader__headshot" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 60vw, 20vw" srcset="../../images/platypus-adventures-grace-edwards@1x.jpeg 360w, ../../images/platypus-adventures-grace-edwards@2x.jpeg 480w" src="../../images/platypus-adventures-grace-edwards@2x.jpeg" alt="headshot of Platypus Adventures leader Grace Edwards"></picture><h2 class="leader__name">Grace Edwards</h2><p class="leader__text">Grace Edwards has been a lifelong resident of Pickens County.

She graduated from Anderson University in 2010 with a major in Psychology and a minor in Sociology and went on to receive her Masters in Forensics Psychology from Walden University in 2012. She began working at the Rape Crisis Center. This led her to her work with Victim Advocate for the 13th Circuit Solicitors Office. In 2016, her son was born with a bilateral cleft palate and lip and a few other medical issues causing her to step away from her career and become a full-time-mom. Her passion for childrenâ€™s advocacy became more meaningful than ever before and she has found new meaning in acceptance, patience, and understanding of children, families and their needs.</p></div><div class="leader"><!-- <picture class="leader__headshot-container">

Greenville has so much to offer kids and families, but as so many places today, is still learning about inclusion and involving non-typical kids. Walking down their street one day, Alison mentioned her mission and TriMyBest and Molly knew she needed to be involved with such a great organization. Yes, the McCombs and Dunlap families live across the street from each other!</p></div><div class="leader"><picture class="leader__headshot-container"><source type="image/webp" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 60vw, 20vw" srcset="../../images/webp/platypus-adventures-david-folkner@1x.webp 360w, ../../images/webp/platypus-adventures-david-folkner@2x.webp 480w"><img class="leader__headshot" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 60vw, 20vw" srcset="../../images/platypus-adventures-david-folkner@1x.jpg 360w, ../../images/platypus-adventures-david-folkner@2x.jpg 480w" src="../../images/platypus-adventures-david-folkner@2x.jpg" alt="headshot of Platypus Adventures leader David Folkner"></picture><h2 class="leader__name">David Folkner</h2><p class="leader__text">David Folkner grew up volunteering in Idaho through scouting, the VA, and many other non-profits.
